To be added, Will explain how to interact with visualizer with your (yes yours) code



still w.i.p

Graph class functions for user-

degree-returns degree of node

neighbors-returns the neighbors of a node

Getedge-extracts specific edge





Set_theory functions for user-

Union-Returns a list containing elements for either list A or list B

Intersection- Returns a list containing elements only found in both list A and list B

Complement -Compares two lists B and A with taking all elements not in A and returning them

Power Set-Generates all sublists of a list

Extra Functions:
Edge min-heap: (evaluates edges by weight, useful for algorithms like Prim or Dijkstra)



Other notes:
Edges are always "weighted" unweighted edges just have a weight of 1.
Example code will be added to help show the user how to visualize your code
